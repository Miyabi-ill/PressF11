Is Terraria too easy for you? Are you craving a challenge? You've come to the right place.
This mod hides all UIs like when you press F11 in the game.
You can't see your inventory, health, mana, buffs, your friendly mouse cursor, and all other UIs.
Don't worry, you can stop this mode by pressing F11 at any time.
